        <h1>Introduction to the album</h1>
       
        <p><b>The Wall</b> is the 11th studio album released by British Psychedelic Rock Band, <b>Pink Floyd</b>. The album, like Pink Floyd's other works is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album#:~:text=A%20concept%20album,of%20%22uniform%20excellence%22.">Concept Album</a>.
         <img id="wallcover" src="./img/wallcover.jpg" alt="The cover of Pink Floyd's 1979 album, 'The Wall'">
        The album follows themes of isolation, abandonment, war, fame, and the emotional “walls” people build to protect themselves from the outside 
            world. Through the story of its main character, Pink, the album explores how trauma and alienation can drive a person to disconnect completely from reality. The album is often considered to be one of Pink Floyd's most emotionally open albums, with songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGC7E3XYZ1M">The Thin Ice</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FLjT5V5Hog&list=OLAK5uy_nEl-NcW1jBoidS2oFQAQGyhrv6m2Ounw4&index=19">Comfortably Numb</a> which's guitar solo is considered to be in the list of the greatest in history.</p> 
        <p>After the album's release, it recieved universal acclaim from various sources, like <a href="https://www.craccum.co.nz/the-wall-1979-album-review/">Craccum</a>, <a href="https://allmusicmagazine.com/classic-retro-album-review-pink-floyd-the-wall/">All Music Magazine</a>, and many others. They all shared the same unanimous conclusion, that this album is a masterpiece. And, it's no wonder why they think that! <b>The Wall</b> is often considered to be the first response to the question "What is a concept album?"</p>

        <h1>The story the album tells <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: help;" title="Contains spoilers for The Wall and Pink Floyd: The Wall">*</span> </h1>

       <!-- <p>One thing that is important to mention when talking about The Wall is that viewers often get confused when the swtiches switches between Pink's imagination, and his true self happen. So, whenever a scene takes place in Pink’s imagination, you’ll see a red asterisk next to it, like this: <span style="color: red; cursor: help; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="This scene is currently Pink's imagination! This is just an example!">*</span>The story starts with a man: J.A. Pinkerton <span style="color: blue; cursor: help; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Explanation: Pink finds a scroll with other military objects with the name J.A. Pinkerton, so it's the most likely scenario.">*</span> who passed away in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, leaving Pink to his mother. Over time, Pink grows up, and does things most people his age do: explode unused bullets under a train, you know, just the normal stuff.</p> -->
        <h2>Part 1 - Pink's early childhood</h2>

        <p>The story starts J.A. Pinkerton, an English soldier, who died in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II </a> from a German bombing</a> in Anzio, Italy. After the death, it was left to his wife to take care of their child, Pink. Pink didn't have an ordinary childhood. He was a part of a very oppressive school system (As seen in the school scenes i.e.: Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2) which according to the lyrics of the song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happiest_Days_of_Our_Lives">The Happiest Days of Our Lives</a>
        </p>
           <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happiest_Days_of_Our_Lives">"When we grew up and went to school <br> 
            There were certain teachers who would hurt the children in any way they could <br> 
            By pouring their derision upon anything we did"</blockquote>
        <p>His mother was also very overprotective of him throughout his childhood. In the song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(Pink_Floyd_song)">Mother</a> We can hear that after his husband died, she became overprotective of Pink, shielding him from everything even remotely resembling harm. This, of course only isolated Pink even more, and his metaphorical wall only grew taller. His mother, of course didn't give up supporting Pink in everything no matter if it's good or bad. We can hear that in the lyric</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(Pink_Floyd_song)">"Of course Mamma's gonna help build the wall"</blockquote>
